The tone should be data-driven and persuasive, framing the shift as a competitive advantage for retention."
    "The Ethics of Autonomous Vehicles: Write a philosophical essay analyzing the 'Trolley Problem' as it applies to the programming of autonomous vehicles. Explore the ethical dilemma of a self-driving car having to choose between saving the life of its passenger or swerving to avoid a group of pedestrians. Discuss the legal implications: if the AI makes a choice that results in a fatality, who is responsible—the manufacturer, the software engineer, or the passenger? Analyze the utilitarian perspective versus the deontological perspective in this context, and argue whether it is possible to encode human morality into a machine learning algorithm that operates on probability rather than explicit rules."
    "Analysis of the Industrial Revolution: Provide a detailed historical analysis of how the Industrial Revolution fundamentally altered the social fabric of 19th-century Britain. Discuss the shift from agrarian lifestyles to urbanization, focusing on the rise of the factory system and the emergence of the working class (proletariat) and the middle class (bourgeoisie). Analyze the impact on family structures, the environment, and public health in overcrowded cities like Manchester and London. furthermore, discuss the political consequences, including the rise of trade unions, the Chartist movement, and the eventual legislative reforms regarding child labor and factory conditions that laid the groundwork for the modern welfare state."
    "Explaining Quantum Entanglement: Explain the concept of Quantum Entanglement to an intelligent teenager who has a basic understanding of high school physics but no background in quantum mechanics. Use an analogy involving two magic coins or dice to explain how the state of one particle can instantly affect the state of another, regardless of the distance between them (Einstein's 'spooky action at a distance'). Discuss the historical debate between Bohr and Einstein regarding hidden variables, and briefly touch upon Bell's Theorem which proved that local realism is incorrect. Finally, explain why this phenomenon does not allow for faster-than-light communication, but how it is being used today in quantum cryptography."
    "Climate Change Mitigation Strategy: Analyze the feasibility of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies as a primary solution for combating climate change. Discuss the current state of Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology, focusing on the energy intensity required to separate CO2 from the atmosphere and the geological challenges of storing it permanently underground. Compare CCS to other mitigation strategies like renewable energy adoption, reforestation, and nuclear power. Argue whether relying on CCS creates a 'moral hazard' that allows fossil fuel companies to continue emitting, or if it is a necessary transition technology given that we have already surpassed certain atmospheric carbon thresholds."
    "The Future of Space Exploration: Evaluate the arguments for and against prioritizing the colonization of Mars versus establishing a permanent base on the Moon. Analyze the logistical challenges of a Mars mission, including the 6-month travel time, radiation exposure, and the communication delay, compared to the relative proximity and resource availability (water ice) of the Moon. Discuss the economic potential of both bodies, such as Helium-3 mining on the Moon versus the long-term goal of making humanity a multi-planetary species via Mars. Conclude with a reasoned opinion on which celestial body should be the primary focus of space agencies like NASA and private companies like SpaceX for the next two decades."
