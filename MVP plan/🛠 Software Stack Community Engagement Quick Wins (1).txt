Executive Summary: The "Community Engine" Framework
This initiative establishes a scalable Contribution Ecosystem to accelerate engineering throughput for TPU software stacks. By shifting from closed development to an "Open Acceleration" model, we enable the community to drive performance enhancements for projects like vLLM, while reducing internal engineering load.
Rather than bespoke fixes, we are building a modular "Community Engine"—a reusable framework of engagement and automation tools designed to be integrated into other major Google Open Source projects like JAX or MaxText.


The Six-Stage Flywheel:[a]
* Concept 1 (The Superpower): Externalize the TPU Kernel Tuner to allow self-service optimization.
* Concept 2 (The Hook): Use Executive Social Alignment to drive high-intent developer traffic.
* Concept 3 (Candy Crush): Lower entry barriers with bite-sized tasks and a gamified "Mission Board".
* Concept 4 (The Leaderboard): Drive retention through automated badges and public recognition.
* Concept 5 (The Golden Path): Solve the Reviewer Bottleneck by automating PR validation and mirroring to Buganizer.
* Concept 6 (Buddy Program): Pair internal engineers with "Hero" contributors (e.g., Stanford) for high-impact strategic unblocking.

Concept 1:The "Superpower" :
 – Externalizing the TPU Kernel Tuner
Key value
	Critical Phase 1 project. It stops the "Performance Cliff" by allowing users to tune their own models without waiting for a Google Eng cycle.
	User action
	Downloads the Externalized Kernel Tuner to optimize a specific model shape.
	Impact
	This is the ultimate "Superpower." It empowers the community to bridge performance gaps themselves, reducing internal engineering load on bespoke tuning requests.
	Low Hanging Fruit (LHF)
	Flip the Script: Rob Mulla has already modularized the tpu-kernel-tuner. We just need to move from private to public validation.
	Our deliverable
	The Tuner Repo: A public, dependency-free Python package that reproduces internal baselines for Quantized Matmul and RPA kernels.
	Stage
	Stage: In Progress ( Building ) 
	Priority:  Very high
	Sizing: M
	Next step
	Timeline: Q1
Current: Already deployed on GitHub, gathering feedback from the internal team.


Next Step: Brittany Rockwellto reach out to rupliu@google.com for touch points with Rupeng and Rob.

Rob Mulla- to refine PR to account for feedback.


Validation: Confirm repro-usability with stakeholders (Janus, Lightricks) before the Q1 public flip.

Concept 2: The "Clean House" Strategy (MVP)
Strategy Alignment & Code Path Unification
Key Value
	Ensures internal readiness before scaling. By unifying fragmented code paths (Flax/JAX vs. PyTorch) and clarifying internal strategy, we prevent "pouring gas on the fire" when engaging external builders.
	User Action
	Consults a transparent Support Matrix. Instead of a "Black Box" experience, a developer sees exactly which features are supported on which implementation path (Jax vs. Torch).
	Impact
	Eliminates "Hidden" Friction. Stops community effort from being wasted on paths Google doesn't intend to adopt (e.g., multimodal Flax contributions that lack parity) and provides a clear roadmap for what work can be outsourced
	Low Hanging Fruit (LHF)
	Surface the Gaps: Immediately update the existing Support Matrix to include dedicated columns for Jax/Flax and Torch to clearly communicate broken areas
	Our deliverable
	The Truth Pipeline:
1. The Transparency Matrix: An expanded support grid showing path-specific feature status.
2. Automated Sweep Suite: A CI/CD testing pipeline (leveraging Gemini for test generation) that runs exhaustive sweeps across all 20+ models and features to identify deficiencies
	Stage
	Stage: Concept        
	Priority:  Very high
	Sizing: XL
	Next step
	Timeline: TBD


Current: Identifying the root causes of fragmentation between vLLM implementation details.
Next Step: Define a standard benchmark for a Customer Usage Journey (CUJ) to be used in automated sweeps.
Validation: Confirm the list of models and features for Gemini to sweep before generating automated test code.

Concept 3: The “Hook[b]”[c] 
– Executive Social Alignment & CTA, enhance awareness  
Quick win
	Directs high-intent traffic to our contribution path rather than just generic "marketing" noise.
	User action
	Sees a high-signal post on different platforms and clicks the "Get Started" link.
	Impact
	Drive more & new potential contributors to our product pages.
Leverages internal "Whale" influence to build external credibility.

Concept 4: The "Compass"
– Enhancing Grassroots Discoverability[d] & Entry Points
Key value
[e]	
Transitioning high-level interest into granular action. It ensures developers don't just "see" the product but can "find" their way into the code, moving from broad awareness to lower-funnel technical onboarding.
	User action
[f]	
A developer seeking to solve a specific problem (e.g., "How do I optimize a Llama-3 shape?") finds a direct path via the README, Contribution Guide, or Technical Site rather than a generic marketing post.
	Impact
	Reduces "High Churn" before the first "Hello World". It prevents the "Black Box" feeling by exposing internal roadmaps and entry points across the entire software stack
	Low Hanging Fruit (LHF)
	The One-Stop Shop: Audit and unify the "Contributor Guide" to include the Support Matrix and a "Contribution Map" that highlights exactly where external effort is currently needed.
	Our deliverable
	The Developer Navigation Hub: A restructured GitHub Landing Page (README) and documentation sidebar that categorizes resources by "Persona" (Enterprise vs. Research) and "Intent" (Using vs. Contributing).

Key difference from the “Hood”
* Segmented Entry Points: Distinguishes between those attending conferences (like PyTorch Con) and those in academia (via TRC).
* Unlike the Gemma 4 launch or Cloud Next, this focus remains active regardless of the marketing calendar.




Concept 5: The "Candy Crush"
– Bite size issues list to get it started
Integrated Github metrics: https://github.com/vllm-project/tpu-inference/pulse
vLLM Docs Metrics: vLLM Analytics Dashboard# 


Key Value
	Lowering the barrier to the first "Merge" creates a dopamine hit that keeps developers in the ecosystem. It transforms complex TPU development into manageable, "flavor-based" tasks.
	User action
	Clicks "Contribute" on the repo and finds a prioritized "Mission Board" of Level 1 (5-minute) and Level 2 (30-minute) fixes.
	Impact
	Increases contributor trust with a low-commitment entry point ; solves high-volume maintenance debt (broken links, typos, type hinting) without draining senior engineering time.
	Low Hanging Fruit (LHF)
	Bite size tasks list for community to “pick” and solve. 
The "Drop Zone": A pinned GitHub issue titled "Found a small bug? Drop it here!" that acts as a catch-all bucket for new "Candy Crush" tasks.

Concept 6: The “Leaderboard”
Gamification, Overall contribution leaderboard, with badges. And a rewarding system
Key Value
	Incentivize repeat contributions by providing public, verifiable status and a rewarding "dopamine loop" for external developers
	User action
	Top contributors are celebrated via public leaderboards and automated digital rewards for hitting specific milestones.
	Impact
	Increases engagement and identifies high-value "Hero" contributors for deeper collaboration. It transforms one-time contributors into long-term stewards.
	Low Hanging Fruit (LHF)
	Tiered Recognition: Create lists for "Top of the Week" or "Top of the Month" and implement automated digital badges for different contribution levels
	Our deliverable

Concept 7: The Unified "Golden Path"  
- Solve the “Reviewer Bottleneck" complaint.
Key value
	The Automated "Golden Path": Solve the “Reviewer Bottleneck” complaint.
Solves the Reviewer Bottleneck by creating a "Shield" (automated validation) and a "Bridge" (internal tracking) so engineers only spend time on high-quality code.
	User Action
	Submits a PR and receives an immediate Automated Performance Report. Once validated, the user sees their PR linked to an internal Google ticket, signaling it is in the formal review queue.
	Impact
	Reduces "Time-to-Merge" by automating 80% of the triage work; protects internal engineering bandwidth from low-quality or non-performant code; provides "Insider" transparency to external devs.
	Low Hanging Fruit (LHF)
	uto-Triage & Mirroring: Use existing GitHub-to-Buganizer scripts to mirror PRs. Implement basic linting and "Dry Run" TPU benchmarks as the first gate.
	Our deliverable
	The Reviewer Relief Suite: 
1. The Shield: A CI/CD pipeline that blocks PRs that fail linting or performance baselines.
2. The Bridge: Bi-directional sync between GitHub and Buganizer for seamless internal visibility.
3. Dedicate internal resources for final approval

Concept 8: The “Buddy program”
Pair internal eng with Hero customers/collaborators
Key Value
	Direct, high-bandwidth collaboration between Google internal engineers and elite external contributors/customers (e.g., Stanford, Lightricks).
	User Action
	Top-tier contributors are "matched" with a Google Buddy for 1:1 syncs, roadmap deep-dives, and technical unblocking.
	Impact
	Fast-tracks complex performance optimizations; builds deep institutional trust; ensures "Hero" customers feel like genuine partners in the TPU roadmap.
	Low Hanging Fruit (LHF)
	The Stanford Pilot: Formalize the existing interaction with Stanford researchers into a structured "Buddy" trial to define the engagement model.
	Our deliverable

MVP Design: The Pilot ( Simplified)
MVP Design Pilot proposal
Goal
Goal on timeline: End of Feb


This MVP establishes a minimal, automated workflow to turn identified code deficiencies into community driven contributions. It serves as the foundational "engine" for our Community Flywheel by proving the viability of the core loop:


1. Auto CUJ → 2. Auto Mission board → 3. Auto leaderboard


________________




Core Automated Workflow
The pilot is centered on a three-step, automated workflow that requires minimal human intervention:
Step 1: Auto CUJ
 Identify "CUJ Breaks" via Automated Sweeps
Action 1: Evolve the Status Language
The current statuses (✅, unverified, N/A) are ambiguous. "Unverified" could mean "broken," "planned," or "we just haven't checked." We can make this much clearer by enriching the language used within the CSV files.


Let's introduce a clearer, more descriptive set of statuses.
Emoji
	Status
	Meaning
	✅
	Passing
	Tested and works as expected. Ready for use.
	⚠️
	Beta
	Works, but may be unstable or have known issues, or performance is not yet optimized. Use with caution.
	❌
	Failing
	Known to be broken or not functional. Help wanted!
	📝
	Planned
	Not yet implemented, but on the official roadmap.
	❓
	Untested
	The functionality exists but has not been recently or thoroughly verified. Its status is unknown.
	

	N/A
	Not applicable for this feature.
	

This would transform the CSV into something much more informative:


Before: （Current Github)
Feature_support_matrix.csv
  

 
The term "Unverified" is confusing users. It will be replaced with clearer status categories like "In Progress," "Planned," or "Not Working On."


After: ( Proposed )

	CorrectnessTest

	KV cache host offloading
	❓ Untested

	5
	LoRA_Torch
	✅Passing
	✅Passing
	The current matrices are too complex. The team is exploring a "cookbook" style visualization or a high-level summary grid (similar to the VLM recipes site) to better show feature support across backends (Flax vs. PyTorch).

	Step 2: Auto Mission Board
The Contributor's Storefront
Goal: Automate the pipeline for "Good First Issues" to drive community engagement.
Mechanism: Customer User Journey (CUJ) breaks (missing or broken tests in CI/CD) will automatically generate issues tagged as "good first issue".
Benefit: Creates a steady stream of easy-to-fix items for external contributors without manual tagging.
Design Task: Improve the Auto-Generated GitHub Issue & Contributing Overview page user experience.   Example: https://reactnative.dev/contributing/overview
Version 1: Mission Board in Github Project


Option 1: Improve the existing Issues page ( suggested for MVP )
              Better tagging, filters in our issue page: “Good first issue” + clear information to improve overall experience.
  

Example: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues


Open challenge: 
Contribution Verification:[i]
* Challenge: Community members currently struggle to verify if their fixes work (turning the matrix "green") without their code being merged into the nightly build.
* Action: The team needs to define a workflow for pre-merge verification.


Version 2: Mission Board on website ( Post MVP)
This is the most popular approach for top-tier open-source projects. You create a simple, dedicated webpage that acts as the Mission Board. With links to the Github Issues detail page.


Existing project: 
* Up For Grabs: https://up-for-grabs.net/#/
* Mozilla Code Tribute: https://codetribute.mozilla.org/


  



Step 3: Auto Leaderboard
Track Contributions & Update Leaderboards
- This step closes the loop by providing recognition, turning a one-time fix into a rewarding experience.


Here is a simple MVP to a more advanced vision, inspired by top-tier open-source projects.


MVP: The "Inclusive Contributor Wall" 
This approach prioritizes collaboration and recognition over competition. It's visually engaging, easy to automate, and makes everyone feel valued from their very first contribution.


Concept:
Instead of a ranked list, we create a visual "wall" of contributor avatars in our README.md. It's not about who is #1; it's about celebrating everyone who has helped. This is heavily inspired by the highly successful all-contributors project.  https://allcontributors.org/


How to Implement It:
1. Use the all-contributors Bot & Spec: This is a well-known tool designed for exactly this purpose.
2. Automate with GitHub Actions: Create a workflow that triggers when a Pull Request is merged.
3. The Flow:
   * When a user's first PR is merged, the GitHub Action calls the all-contributors bot.
   * The bot automatically adds the user's avatar to a grid in your README.md or a CONTRIBUTORS.md file.
   * Crucially, you can configure it to recognize different types of contributions with emojis (e.g., 💻 for code, 📖 for documentation, 🐛 for bug reports).
4. Extend it for Reviewers: Create a separate, simpler action that triggers when a PR is approved. This action adds the reviewer's avatar to a special "Community Reviewers" section.
Why it's a great MVP:
* Highly Inclusive: It celebrates everyone, regardless of the size of their contribution.
* Visual & Personal: Seeing your own face on a project's README is a powerful and rewarding experience.
* Encourages More Than Code: It explicitly values documentation, bug reports, and reviews.
* Low Friction: It's fully automated and lives right on the main project page.
