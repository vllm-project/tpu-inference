Title: Building the Software Stack "Community Engine"
Subtitle: Hustle & Have Fun: Redefining UX/PM/Eng Collaboration
Presenters: [Your Name] (UX), Brittany (PM), Rob (Eng)

SPEAKER NOTES:
"Hi everyone. Today, Brittany, Rob, and I want to share a story about how we completely reimagined how UX, Product, and Engineering collaborate. By leaning into the principles of 'Stay Scrappy' and 'Hustle & Have Fun', we moved from a blank whiteboard to a fully functional 'Community Engine' MVP in exactly 3 months."

==================================================
SLIDE 2: The Opportunity & The "Scrappy" Shift
==================================================
* User Problem: External contributors faced a "Black Box" when trying to build on our TPU software stack—it was too hard to know what was broken or where to start.
* Business Problem: Internal engineers were drowning in review bottlenecks and bespoke support requests, slowing down our own feature velocity.
* The Opportunity (Open Acceleration): Enable the community to drive performance enhancements (like vLLM) so internal engineers don't have to.
* The Mindset ("Stay Scrappy"): Stop standard, pixel-perfect design cycles. We rapidly brainstormed the "Six-Stage Flywheel" concepts to find our hook, and then immediately jumped into building a working MVP (the end-to-end automated flow).
  *(Note: Insert screenshot of the brainstorm deck/whiteboard here!)*

SPEAKER NOTES:
"The core issue was that community developers wanted to build on our TPU software stack, but faced a 'Black Box'. Internally, our engineers were drowning in bespoke requests and review bottlenecks. 
Instead of doing what we normally do—spending weeks on high-fidelity Figma mockups and PM requirements docs—we got scrappy. We defined a 'Six-Stage Flywheel' for community engagement, and immediately started writing code to build the foundational automation MVP."

==================================================
SLIDE 3: The MVP – The "Community Engine"  
==================================================
* What we built: A 3-step automated workflow requiring zero human intervention:
  1. Auto CUJ (The Truth Pipeline): Automated sweeps find TPU test failures and expose them in a transparent matrix.
  2. Auto Mission Board (Candy Crush): Those failures automatically generate "Good First Issues" to lower the entry barrier for contributors.
  3. Auto Leaderboard: Triggers an automated "Inclusive Contributor Wall" update when code is merged, rewarding the dopamine loop.
  *(Note: Insert a screenshot of the "Mission Board" or "Contributor Wall" here to show the final product!)*

SPEAKER NOTES:
"Our MVP focused purely on the automated workflow to eliminate human overhead. We call it the Community Engine. 
Step 1 is the Auto CUJ, which automatically detects missing features and surfaces them. Step 2 is the 'Candy Crush' Mission Board: those gaps automatically turn into bite-sized GitHub issues. Step 3 closes the loop—when the community merges a fix, an automated Leaderboard updates to celebrate them. We went from concept to a live, automated ecosystem in 3 months."

==================================================
SLIDE 4: Roles Reimagined ("Mission First")
==================================================
* UX / Design ([Your Name]): Erased the "mockup" boundary. Wrote the actual working Python code and GitHub Actions to automate the MVP.
* Engineering (Rob): Shifted to an accelerator. Helped modularize the kernel tuner, solved complex infrastructure blocks, and reviewed the designer's code.
* Product (Brittany): Managed the "Hockey Stick". Aligned the internal strategy, prioritized the "Golden Path", and provided continuous input without stalling execution.

SPEAKER NOTES:
"The secret to doing this in 3 months was erasing our traditional job titles and working 'Mission First'. 
I stepped outside UX and actually wrote the working Python scripts and GitHub Actions to bring the Mission Board to life. Rob shifted from strictly writing features to acting as an accelerator—reviewing my code and modularizing the internal tuner. And Brittany focused on unblocking us and aligning our work with the wider TPU strategy without slowing down our daily execution."

==================================================
SLIDE 5: The Impact & The Future
==================================================
* Impact: A live, scalable Contribution Ecosystem that reduces internal engineering load and increases external velocity.
* Key Takeaway: Proving value via working code (Stay Scrappy) builds momentum faster than pitching slides.
* Our Ask: How can leadership help us scale this embedded, high-velocity ("Hustle & Have Fun") team model to other critical infrastructure tracks?

SPEAKER NOTES:
"The impact here isn't just a cool GitHub script. We've built a scalable engine that actively reduces our internal engineering load. 
What we learned is that proving value via working code builds unstoppable momentum. 
Our ask for you today is this: How can we scale this exact model—this high-velocity, boundary-less collaboration—to other critical infrastructure teams at Google?"
