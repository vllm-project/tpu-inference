def round_up_to_multiple_of_128_within_limit(x: int, limit: int) -> int:
    """
    Rounds the given integer `x` up to the nearest multiple of 128, without
    exceeding the specified `limit`.

    If `x` is less than or equal to 128, returns 128.
    If `x` is less than `limit`, returns the smallest multiple of 128 greater
    than or equal to `x`.
    If `x` is greater than or equal to `limit`, searches for the largest
    multiple of 128 less than or equal to `limit` (down to 512) that divides `x`
    evenly, and returns it.
    If no such candidate is found, returns `limit`.

    Args:
        x (int): The integer to round up.
        limit (int): The upper bound (must be a multiple of 128).

    Returns:
        int: The rounded value according to the rules above.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If `limit` is less than 128 or not a multiple of 128.
