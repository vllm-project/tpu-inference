# UI UX Pro Max Skill Workflow

When building the UI/UX for any feature in this workspace, you MUST reference the design intelligence from the UI UX Pro Max skill.

1. Review the Core Concepts and Prompts stored inside `.agents/skills/ui-ux-pro-max-skill/README.md` and `.agents/skills/ui-ux-pro-max-skill/CLAUDE.md`.
2. Review specific UX guidelines located in `.agents/skills/ui-ux-pro-max-skill/src` dependent on the feature being built.
3. Apply the 50+ UI styles, Font pairings, and color palettes described in the skill repository to ensure top-tier, professional design.
