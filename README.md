## About

vLLM TPU is now powered by `tpu-inference`, an expressive and powerful new hardware plugin unifying JAX and PyTorch under a single lowering path within the vLLM project. The new backend now provides a framework for developers to:

- Push the limits of TPU hardware performance in open source.
- Provide more flexibility to JAX and PyTorch users by running PyTorch model definitions performantly on TPU without any additional code changes, while also extending native support to JAX.
- Retain vLLM standardization: keep the same user experience, telemetry, and interface.

## Recommended models and features

Although vLLM TPUâ€™s new unified backend makes out-of-the-box high performance serving possible with any model supported in vLLM, the reality is that we're still in the process of implementing a few core components.

For this reason, weâ€™ve provided a **[Recommended Models and Features](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/tpu/en/latest/recommended_models_features.html)** page detailing the models and features that are validated through unit, integration, and performance testing.

## Get started

Get started with vLLM on TPUs by following the [quickstart guide](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/tpu/en/latest/getting_started/quickstart.html).

Visit our [documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/tpu/en/latest/) to learn more.

**Compatible TPU Generations**
- Recommended: v5e, v6e
- Experimental: v3, v4, v5p

*Check out a few v6e recipes [here](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/tpu-recipes/tree/main/inference/trillium/vLLM)!*

## Contribute

We're always looking for ways to partner with the community to accelerate vLLM TPU development. If you're interested in contributing to this effort, check out the [Contributing guide](https://github.com/vllm-project/tpu-inference/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Issues](https://github.com/vllm-project/tpu-inference/issues) to start. We recommend filtering Issues on the [**good first issue** tag](https://github.com/vllm-project/tpu-inference/issues?q=is%3Aissue+state%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) if it's your first time contributing.
