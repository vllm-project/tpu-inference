## 👋&nbsp; About 

vLLM TPU is now powered by `tpu-inference`, an expressive and powerful new hardware plugin unifying JAX and PyTorch under a single lowering path within the vLLM project. The new backend now provides a framework for developers to:

- Push the limits of TPU hardware performance in open source.
- Provide more flexibility to JAX and PyTorch users by running PyTorch model definitions performantly on TPU without any additional code changes, while also extending native support to JAX.
- Retain vLLM standardization: keep the same user experience, telemetry, and interface.
<br>

## ⭐&nbsp; Recommended models and features

Although vLLM TPU’s new unified backend makes out-of-the-box high performance serving possible with any model supported in vLLM, the reality is that we're still in the process of implementing a few core components.

For this reason, we’ve provided a **[Recommended Models and Features](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/tpu/en/latest/recommended_models_features/)** page detailing the models and features that are validated through unit, integration, and performance testing.

<br>

## 🚀&nbsp; Get started

Get started with vLLM on TPUs by following the [quickstart guide](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/tpu/en/latest/getting_started/quickstart/).

Visit our [documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/tpu/en/latest/) to learn more.

**Compatible TPU Generations**
- Recommended: v7x, v5e, v6e
- Experimental: v3, v4, v5p
